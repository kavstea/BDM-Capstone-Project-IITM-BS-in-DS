Grade: S

Time spent: 2 terms (with some procrastination)

For this project, I worked with an astrology business to understand their problems, analyze their data, and find trends. I then gave simple, practical recommendations. The focus was more on writing reports and explaining the data than on using complex analysis tools. I used Excel and Google Sheets to create basic charts and spot patterns. The best part was writing the three reports.

The proposal report (done in MS Word) covered the business and its challenges.
The mid-term report (done in Google Docs) explained the dataâ€™s key details and stats.
The final report (done in Google Docs) included the analysis, findings, and recommendations.
I wrapped everything up in a 10-page presentation (done in Google Slides).
