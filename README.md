Grade: S

Time spent: 2 terms (with some procrastination)

For this project, I worked with an astrology business to understand their problems, analyze their data, and spot trends. Based on this, I gave simple, practical recommendations. The focus was more on writing reports and explaining the data clearly, rather than using complex tools. I used Excel and Google Sheets to create basic charts and highlight key patterns.

The proposal report (done in MS Word) explained the business and its challenges.
The mid-term report (done in Google Docs) covered the key details of the data.
The final report (done in Google Docs) presented the analysis, results, and recommendations.
I finished it up with a 10-page presentation (done in Google Slides).
