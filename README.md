for me, this project was about essay writing and data story telling than applying complex data analysis techniques/tools.
I used Excel and Google Sheets to make simple charts from the data and found patterns in it followed by writing 3 reports (most absorbing part):

one on Business Background and it's Challenges;

another on Meta Data and Descriptive Statistics of the data used for the analysis; 

last one on Results-Findings-Interpretations-Recommedations;

and then i wrapped up the project journey in 10-page presentation.
