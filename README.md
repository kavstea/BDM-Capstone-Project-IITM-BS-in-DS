in this project, i worked with an astrology business to understand their challenges, analyzed their data to identify trends, and provided recommendations to address those issues.

for me, this project was more about essay writing and data storytelling than applying complex data analysis techniques or tools. i used excel and google sheets to create simple charts from the data and identify patterns, followed by writing three reports (the most absorbing part):

one on the business background and its challenges
another on the metadata and descriptive statistics of the data used for the analysis
the last one on results, findings, interpretations, and recommendations
finally, i wrapped up the project journey in a 10-page presentation.
