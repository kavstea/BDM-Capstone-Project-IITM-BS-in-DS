>In this project, I collaborated with an astrology business to understand their challenges, analyze their data, and identify trends. I provided recommendations to address these issues. The focus was more on essay writing and data storytelling than on using advanced data analysis techniques or tools. I used Excel and Google Sheets to create simple charts from the data to spot patterns. The most engaging part was writing three detailed reports.

>The proposal report covered the business background and its challenges.
>
>The mid term focused on the metadata and descriptive statistics of the data used for analysis.
>
>The final report presented results, findings, interpretations, and recommendations.
>
>In the end, the project journey was summarized in a 10-page presentation.
