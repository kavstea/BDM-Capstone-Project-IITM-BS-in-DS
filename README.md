# Project Overview 

**Grade:** S 

**Time Spent:** 2 terms (with some procrastination)  

For this project, I teamed up with an astrology business to understand their challenges, dive into their data, and find trends. I provided them with practical recommendations based on the insights I discovered. The focus was more on writing reports and clearly explaining the data rather than using complex analysis tools. I used **Excel** and **Google Sheets** to create simple charts that helped identify patterns.
