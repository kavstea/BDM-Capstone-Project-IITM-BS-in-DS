Grade: S

Time spent: 2 terms (with some procrastination)

For this project, I teamed up with an astrology business to understand their challenges, dive into their data, and find trends. I gave them practical recommendations based on what I found. The focus was more on writing reports and clearly explaining the data rather than using complex analysis tools. I used Excel and Google Sheets to create simple charts that helped identify patterns.

The proposal report (in MS Word) covered the business background and its main challenges.

The mid-term report (in Google Docs) explained the dataâ€™s key details and basic stats.

The final report (in Google Docs) included the analysis, findings, and recommendations.

In the end, I wrapped everything up in a 10-page presentation (in Google Slides) that summed up all the important points.
