no. of terms spent: 2 (procrastination inclusive)

not too advanced, this project was more about essay writing and data story telling than applying or using in-depth/technical data analysis techniques/tools.
all i did was used excel/google sheets to make basic basic charts from the data to find the patterns, writing 3 reports (very therapeutic) detailing-

Business Background and it's challenges;

Meta Data and Descriptive Statistics of the Data used for the analysis; 

Results-Findings-Interpretations-Recommedations;

and finally summarizing the whole project journey in a 10 page ppt.
